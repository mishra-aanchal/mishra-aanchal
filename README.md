<p>Communities have a very special place in my heart and with a passion for helping communities, I love helping and creating opportunities for student developers.💖</p> 
<p>I organize community events, give talks and mentor student developers.
As a part of my regular interaction with the student developer communities, I'm usually part of various communities, Hackathons and events with different roles such as speaker, mentor, judge, etc.👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 
 I've been able to impact 20000+ student developers and this is just the beginning.🤍</p>
I love traveling, listening to music and spending time interacting with community, meeting new people.💖
